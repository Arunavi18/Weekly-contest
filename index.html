                            Hampi is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, owing to the ancient temples, forts and other monuments here. <br>Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagar Empire around 1500 AD, and by some accounts, the second largest city in the world at that time. <br>Over the next centuries it fell out of importance, and now there lie ruins of a lot of temples and other structures spread out over a vast area. The terrain around Hampi is as mysterious as the ruins itself - the city is surrounded by boulders of different sizes, <br>and you can climb to the top of them with a little effort to get a stunning view of the entire city and the geography. <br>It is located on the banks of the Tungabhadra River. Famous for its massive, beautifully carved temples, Hampi tells the stories of its existing structures. <br>Many a visitor climb atop the Matangaparvata and get a glimpse of Hampi and its environs. The way the city was built with temples and bazaars is exemplary in itself. <br>On the North banks of the river Tungabhadra is the first capital of the Vijayanagar Empire, Anegundi, the temples and stories abound, which will help one to get a better understanding of the local heritage.
